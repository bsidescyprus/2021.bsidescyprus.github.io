				<h2>CODE OF CONDUCT</h2>
				</p>
				//ETHICS
				<p class=text-justify style="color: #000;">
				BSides Cyprus is dedicated to providing a harassment-free, constructive, 
				inclusive and pleasant atmosphere for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination of conference 
				participants in any form. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the 
				conference without a refund. We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related 
				social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too! 
				</p>
				<p class=text-justify style="color: #000;">
				If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. 
				Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want 
				all participants to be happy at our event. Contact a conference volunteer, identified by a volunteer shirt/lanyard, 
				the volunteer will get one of the organisers to take your report, or you can contact an organiser directly, identified
				 by an organiser shirt/lanyard.
				</p>
				//ETHICS
				<p>
				<h2>PHOTO/VIDEO/RECORDING DEVICE POLICY</h2>
				</p>
				//PRIVACY
				<p class=text-justify style="color: #000;">
				BSides Cyprus is an open space, where everyone participating should feel free to share their ideas, stories, and any other passion they pursue. With that said, privacy is a big concern in the hacker community, as well as with the public at large, and we need
				to establish a clear set of boundaries when it comes to balancing privacy and capturing moments. Using your best effort and judgment, please try to ensure you have permission from anyone you photograph or record. This includes, but is not limited to, anyone in the 
				background of your shot. For the record, “crowd shots” from the front (facing the crowd) are strongly discouraged.
				If you’ve taken a picture without permission, delete it. If you’re asked by a participant to delete or blur a picture they did not give you permission to take, and you are on BSides Cyprus property, do so immediately.
				</p>
				<p class=text-justify style="color: #000;">
				Upon a first infraction, you will receive one warning from BSides Cyprus staff. Upon a second infraction you will be asked to give up your device to BSides Cyprus Safety Operations for secure storage for the duration of your stay at the event; or you’ll be asked to leave the 
				event with your device – your choice. You may return to the event once you have deposited your device somewhere else.
				There are official BSides Cyprus Photographers. They will have professional cameras and staff badges. They are aware of this policy and are not exempt, except in cases where they have been requested to document activities, official parties, or presentations for BSides Cyprus purposes.
				If you believe that anyone is breaking these rules please bring it to the attention of BSides Cyprus staff members.
